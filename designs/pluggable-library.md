# Library Plugins

## Summary

Building on the Node-RED Plugins design, we can now look at supporting Library Plugins.

A library plugin acts as an alternative source of content for the libraries shown
in the editor.

For example, a library hosted on a remote URL, or an additional library on the local
filesystem.

An example use case is where a team of developers want a shared library of reusable
assets. They have a shared drive mounted on each of their computers (or could be
via a service like Dropbox). They want to be able to access the content of that
shared drive when loading/saving flows and other assets within the editor.

## Details

A library plugin consists of two parts:

1. a runtime plugin that implements a defined API to act as a library source
2. an optional editor plugin that allows the user to dynamically configure new instances of the plugin

This design is currently focussed on statically adding new library sources via
the settings file. More work is needed to design how a user may add/config new
sources via the editor.


### Runtime plugin

The following is the skeleton of an example runtime plugin

```
module.exports = function(RED) {

    class FileStorePlugin {
        constructor(config) {
            this.config = config;

        }
        async init() {
            console.log("FileStorePlugin.init")

        }
        async getEntry(type,path) {
            console.log("FileStorePlugin.getLibraryEntry",type,path)
            return []
        }
        async saveEntry(type,path,meta,body) {
            console.log("FileStorePlugin.saveLibraryEntry",type,path)

        }
    }

    RED.plugins.registerPlugin("node-red-library-filestore", {
        type: "node-red-library-source",
        class: FileStorePlugin
    })
}
```
1. The plugin defines a class (`FileStorePlugin`) that implements a standard api:
  - `constructor(config)` : passed in the configuration for the plugin instance
  - `init()` : optional async function to perform any initialisation of the plugin.
  - `getEntry(type,path)` : get an entry from the library
  - `saveEntry(type,path,meta,body)` : save an entry to the library
  - `deleteEntry(type,path)` : remove an entry from the library
2. It registers itself as a plugin with a type of `node-red-library-source` and
   provides a reference to its class

*TODO* add more details on `get/save/deleteEntry` functions. Their behaviour should
match the existing file system store we already have... although `deleteEntry` is
a new option that hasn't existed before.

### Editor plugin

*This needs more work to fill out the details*

To allow the user to add and configure new instances of the plugin via the editor,
it needs to provide an editor plugin.

In a similar way to nodes, it provides a list of configuration properties. I don't
know yet if we need to provide more custom edit functionality - or whether auto-generating
a config screen of key/values pairs based on these defaults is sufficient.

This is an area where the design may evolve over future versions.

```
<script type="text/javascript">
    RED.plugins.registerPlugin("node-red-library-filestore", {
        type: "node-red-library-source",
        name: "Local File-System Library",
        icon: "font-awesome/fa-hdd-o",
        defaults: {
            name: { value: "" },
            path: { value: ""}
        }
    })
</script>
```

### HTTP Admin API

#### `/settings`

The list of configured libraries is added to the `/settings` end point. The default
value is:

```
{
    "libraries": [
        {
            "id": "local",
            "label": "editor:library.types.local",
            "user": false,
        },
        {
            "id": "examples",
            "label": "editor:library.types.examples",
            "user": false,
            "readOnly": true,
            "types": [
                "flows"
            ]
        }
    ]
}
```

This default shows the definition of the built-in libraries - the local lib and
examples lib.

 - `id` : unique identifier for this library.
 - `label`: the label to show for the library. It gets passed through `RED._()` so can be a message catalog reference
 - `user` : whether this is a user-configurable library
 - `readOnly`: whether this is a read-only library.
 - `types`: an array of asset types the library supports.
 - (not shown) `icon`: an optional FA-icon identifier.


A 'user-configurable' library is one the user has added via the editor UI. The default
libraries and any configured via the settings file are *not* user-configurable.


#### `/library/:id`

***This is not in the plan for 1.3 - we'll revisit it in the future***

This new admin endpoint will return information about a specific library.

The object returned will match those returned by the `/settings` endpoint under
the `libraries` object.

In the case of user-configurable libraries, it will include an additional property:

 - `config`: a key/value object of configurable properties for the library.

If any of the configuration properties are flagged as `password` type properties,
rather than return the value, it will include a property with the name `has_<property-name>`
as a boolean to indicate whether the runtime has a value stored or not. This is
inline with how flow credentials are handled and the general principle of never
returning passwords back to the editor.

To update the configuration of a user-configurable library, a `PUT` HTTP Request
can be sent to the same endpoint with the updated object.

#### `/library/:id/:type`

This is the existing endpoint used to browse the contents of the library for a given
type of object.


### `@node-red/runtime` API

***This is not in the plan for 1.3 - we'll revisit it in the future***

*TODO: define the APIs to support adding/configuring new library sources in the editor*

### Settings file

A user can define new library sources via their settings file using the new `editorTheme.library`
setting:

```
editorTheme: {
    library: {
        sources: [
            {
                id:   "team-dir",
                type: "node-red-library-filestore",
                label: "my team-dir",
                path: "/tmp/nr-lib/"
            }
        ]
    }
}
```

For each source:
 - `id` : unique identifier for the library source instance
 - `type`: the type of library plugin this is an instance of
 - `label`: how the library is labelled in the UI
 - ... anything else is then plugin-specific configuration.

Any source defined in the settings file will get its `user` property set to `false`
as it cannot be reconfigured in the editor.
